							<h2 class="major">Battle Heros</h2>
							<a class="image main"><img src="images/mq3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p> A Firstperson Shooter Game (PVP - Multiplayer), Where the player who gets the highest kill count in a match wins.</p>
							<h3 class="major"> Project Description </h3>
							<p><b> Genre :</b> Action, Shooter </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Level Designer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>As a level designer, I focused on creating multiplayer maps for <i>Battle Heroes</i>. Each map needed spawn points for 10 players, and the level design was built around that requirement. I also participated in playtesting to ensure everything functioned as intended.</p>
							<p>This was the first project where I experimented with <i>Unity’s optimization tools</i>. The assets used to build the level were sourced from the Unity Asset Store, and several underwent optimization, such as polygon reduction.</p>
							<p>For example, some asset packages included multiple houses with interiors, which made the models heavier to render. By removing the interiors, we reduced the polygon count and improved frame rates.</p>
							<p>We also implemented various other optimizations to enhance performance without sacrificing too much visual quality. This project helped me better understand the importance of level metrics, scale, and optimization in game development.</p>

							<h3 class="major"> Project Description </h3>
							<p><b> Genre :</b> Puzzle </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Game Designer and Programmer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p> This project allowed my internship employer to test my programming skills in <i>Unity</i>. During this project, I implemented a two-dimensional array, a concept I had first learned during my C# studies, and used it to set up the intended functionality. </p>
							<p>Since I didn’t know how to apply a three-dimensional array in the game, I looked for an online tutorial to figure out how I could implement the concept. The code I found in a tutorial was for a 2D array, and I adapted it to work in 3D.</p>
							<p>I modified the code based on my understanding of the concept. While the result looked like what I wanted, its behavior was different from what I expected. After a few iterations and some help from a colleague, I was able to get the code running as intended.</p>
							<p>It was a fun endeavor, and the experience sparked my interest in prototyping games—especially during the early stages of development.</p>

							<a class="image main"><img src="images/IE.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p> Escape the island with the help of a slingshot, but beware of roaming pirates.</p>
							<h3 class="major"> Project Description </h3>
							<p><b> Genre :</b> Action, Hyper-Casual </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Game Designer, Level Designer and Programmer. </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p><i>Island Escape</i> is a game that was selected by the COO of Ether Games from a few concepts I had pitched, including a prototype. Initially, it was designed as a typical hyper-casual game where the player needed to collect parts to fix a small boat and escape the island. At that stage, the COO wasn’t particularly interested.</p>
							<p>Then I had a new idea: the character would try to escape the island by throwing a stone at passing ships. The ships could either be standard cargo ships or pirate ships, but this wouldn’t be revealed until the ship responded to the player's distress signal (i.e., after the stone hit the ship). 
							That twist made the concept more interesting — and it turned out that one of my colleagues had already developed a version of the game with a small variation.</p>
							<p>One day, that colleague shared some files with me, and the COO asked me to re-create the game. He also shared a gameplay video for reference. I took this opportunity to explore some programming concepts — I broke things, fixed them, and eventually made it work.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Shadow Master</h2>
							<a class="image main"><img src="images/SM.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>A hyper-casual game where players must rebuild a missing part of a walking path by matching shadows cast by random objects to complete the path.</p>
							<h3 class="major"> Project Description </h3>
							<p><b> Genre :</b> Hyper-Casual </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Level Designer and Programmer. </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>This concept was developed internally. I first created a prototype based on an idea that came to mind, and it was initially set in a 3D world. </p>
							<p>When I began developing the prototype, I struggled to find a good camera system. I couldn’t figure out a camera angle that would work well for both touch controls and overall gameplay visibility. After a brief discussion with my colleague, he mentioned that he had set up the game using a <i>Side-Scroller</i> perspective. It turned out to be the perfect choice for this type of game, so I switched the perspective to a side-scrolling (2D) view. </p>

							<p><b> Genre :</b> Hyper-Casual, Puzzle </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Programmer and Level Designer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>This was another project I used to test and improve my <i>C# skills</i> in the <i>Unity engine</i>. All the assets were already provided, and I recreated the game with my own level designs.</p>
							<p><i>Robber Rush</i> is a game that unexpectedly taught me the importance of <i>Level Metrics</i>. Surprisingly, I didn’t even think about level metrics while working on it, yet the level turned out pretty good. I guess I was subconsciously aware of them, and that somehow guided me while designing the level — like muscle memory kicking in.</p>

							<p><b> Role :</b> Level Designer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>The COO of Ether Games found the <i>IRDS Controller</i> assets on the <i>Unity Asset Store</i> and asked me to take a look at them. I then created a prototype with a level based on those assets.</p>
							<p>The IRDS Controller is best suited for racing games that require a somewhat realistic physics system. While I’m not sure if IRDS is ideal for pure simulation-style games, it did allow me to experiment with various settings to create multiple vehicles, each with different physics behaviors.</p>

							<p>This is a pitch made for a publisher. By the time it reached me, the game designs were already completed, and my senior shared his vision, assigning me to design a level for the game.</p>
							<p>Initially, the gameplay was simple, but as development progressed, my team realized the game would work better as a puzzle. So, the simple gameplay was transformed into a puzzle.</p>

							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>This is another pitch made for a publisher. To create the intended experience, we needed to simulate a rope. We tested various assets, selected one, and built the game around it.</p> 
							<p>During development, we encountered multiple bugs related to the physics simulation, but we eventually made the game playable with 15 levels. I was assigned as the team leader for this project, where I stayed focused on the game's vision, guided my fellow developers, and helped bring the game to life.</p>

							<p><b> Genre :</b> Hyper-Casual, Action, Shooter </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Level Designer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>The game was published and began collecting data from users. I was tasked with making changes to the game based on this data. This is another project where I led a small team.</p>
							<p><i>Weapons Inc.</i> was a project that made me truly appreciate the value of having solid technical knowledge in game development — especially during critical moments.</p>
							<p>The game was plagued by a persistent hard crash, and neither I nor my team could figure out what was going wrong. The game had integrated an SDK from a third party, and I suspected it might be causing a memory leak. The SDK provider’s website even included a warning that improper usage could lead to such issues, though we had no concrete evidence to confirm it.</p>
							<p>Based on this assumption, I rewrote the C# code to better manage memory and prevent potential leaks. After several rounds of rewriting and testing, the mysterious crash was finally resolved — thanks to my understanding of the Unity engine and the C# language. The game is now stable and live on Google Play.</p>

							<p><b> Genre :</b> Puzzle </p>
							<p><b> Target Platform :</b> Android </p>
							<p><b> Role :</b> Level Designer </p>
							<h4 class="major"> My Work </h4>
							<p>This is the first game in which I used a <i>Custom Level Generator Tool</i> to quickly create <i>Cross-Levels</i>. As a level designer, I applied my basic mathematical skills to develop these levels.</p>
							<p>The tool made my work much easier and gave me more time to playtest my creations. On top of that, it included additional features that allowed us to generate cross-levels with varying difficulty. </p>
                                                        <p>Not only did the tool generate the cross-levels, but it also created math equations for them. I used a mix of auto-generated equations and custom ones that I created myself.</p> 
							<p>While working on <i>RiddleMath</i>, my Senior Designer introduced me to the concept of <i>Primed Levels — levels that are carefully handcrafted by designers to deliver a specific experience to the player</i>. This helped shape the overall quality and intention behind the level design.</p>
							<p>The game is currently live on <i>Google Play</i>.</p>

							<p>This is one of the client projects I worked on at <i>Knifecake Studios</i>, where we were tasked with improving the game. Our plan was to enhance the visuals and add new levels. As a level designer, my goal was to create a compelling puzzle experience by introducing difficulty spikes at certain intervals to challenge players by experimenting with timer and in-game objectives.</p>
							<p>The game has been updated on the <i>Google Play</i>, and real-world testing is currently in progress.</p>
